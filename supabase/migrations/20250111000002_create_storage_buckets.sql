-- Storage buckets analysis: No actual file uploads needed
-- 
-- Analysis shows:
-- 1. ChatbotRequestForm has upload code but is only used in unused ChatbotRequests component
-- 2. MediaLibrary only stores URLs/links, not actual files
-- 3. Other components have file inputs but no actual upload logic
-- 
-- Therefore, no storage buckets are needed for the current application.
-- 
-- If file uploads are needed in the future, create buckets as needed.
