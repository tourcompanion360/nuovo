# ðŸš€ TourCompanion SaaS - Complete Setup Guide

## ðŸ“‹ **What I've Created For You**

I've built a complete full-stack SaaS application with:

### âœ… **Database & Backend:**
- **8 Core Tables** with proper relationships
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for data isolation
- **Database Functions** for analytics and statistics
- **Materialized Views** for performance
- **Sample Data** for testing
- **Real-time Subscriptions** for live updates

### âœ… **Frontend Application:**
- **React Components** updated to use new database
- **Custom Hooks** for data fetching and authentication
- **TypeScript Types** matching database schema
- **Real-time Features** integrated
- **Subscription Plan Management**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 1: Create Your Database**

### **Option A: Use Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. **Go to your Supabase project:**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yrvicwapjsevyilxdzsm/sql

2. **Open SQL Editor:**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Run the Complete Setup Script:**
   - Copy the entire contents of `DATABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

4. **Verify Setup:**
   - You should see "Database setup completed successfully!"
   - Check that all 8 tables are created
   - Verify sample data is inserted

### **Option B: Manual Setup (If needed)**

If the SQL script doesn't work, you can run the migration file:
- Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20250110000000_complete_saas_schema.sql`
- Run in Supabase SQL Editor

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 2: Verify Your Database**

After running the setup script, you should see:

### **Tables Created:**
- âœ… `creators` - Tour creator/agency accounts
- âœ… `end_clients` - Clients of tour creators
- âœ… `projects` - Virtual tour projects
- âœ… `chatbots` - AI chatbots for projects
- âœ… `leads` - Captured leads from chatbots
- âœ… `analytics` - Project analytics data
- âœ… `requests` - Client change requests
- âœ… `assets` - File management

### **Sample Data:**
- âœ… 1 Demo Agency (creator)
- âœ… 3 End Clients (Sarah Johnson, Michael Chen, Emily Rodriguez)
- âœ… 2 Projects (TechCorp Office Tour, Product Showcase)
- âœ… 1 Chatbot (TechCorp Support Bot)
- âœ… 3 Leads (John Doe, Jane Smith, Bob Wilson)
- âœ… 4 Analytics entries
- âœ… 2 Requests
- âœ… 3 Assets

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 3: Test Your Application**

1. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your application:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Navigate to different sections

3. **Test the features:**
   - **Chatbot Management**: Should show sample chatbots
   - **Media Library**: Should show sample clients and assets
   - **Projects**: Should display sample projects
   - **Analytics**: Should show sample data

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 4: Understanding Your Database Structure**

### **Data Flow:**
```
Creator (1) â†’ End Clients (many) â†’ Projects (many) â†’ Chatbots (many) â†’ Leads (many)
                    â†“                    â†“
                Requests (many)    Analytics (many)
                    â†“
                Assets (many)
```

### **User Types:**
1. **Creators**: Tour creators/agencies (paying customers)
2. **End Clients**: Clients of creators (receive branded portals)

### **Key Features:**
- **Multi-tenant**: Each creator only sees their own data
- **Real-time**: Live updates for leads, analytics, requests
- **Secure**: RLS policies prevent data leakage
- **Scalable**: Built for growth with proper indexing

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 5: Customize Your Application**

### **Update Sample Data:**
You can modify the sample data in `DATABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.sql` to match your needs.

### **Add Real Authentication:**
Currently using anonymous sessions for demo. To add real authentication:

1. **Enable Supabase Auth:**
   - Go to Authentication â†’ Settings in Supabase
   - Configure email/password auth

2. **Update Components:**
   - Replace `createAnonymousSession()` with real sign-up/sign-in
   - Update user management in components

### **Connect Real Data:**
- Replace sample data with real client information
- Connect to actual virtual tour platforms
- Integrate with real chatbot services

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 6: Production Deployment**

### **Environment Variables:**
Make sure these are set in production:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://yrvicwapjsevyilxdzsm.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### **Database Security:**
- RLS policies are already configured
- Service role key should be kept secret
- Regular backups recommended

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Table doesn't exist" errors:**
   - Make sure you ran the complete SQL script
   - Check that all 8 tables were created

2. **"Permission denied" errors:**
   - RLS policies are working correctly
   - This is expected for unauthorized access

3. **"No data showing" in app:**
   - Check that sample data was inserted
   - Verify the anonymous user ID matches

4. **Build errors:**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
   - Check TypeScript types match database schema

### **Verification Queries:**

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify setup:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('creators', 'end_clients', 'projects', 'chatbots', 'leads', 'analytics', 'requests', 'assets')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check sample data
SELECT 'Creators' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.creators
UNION ALL
SELECT 'End Clients', COUNT(*) FROM public.end_clients
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Projects', COUNT(*) FROM public.projects
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Chatbots', COUNT(*) FROM public.chatbots
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Leads', COUNT(*) FROM public.leads;
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **Success Criteria**

Your setup is successful when:

- âœ… All 8 tables exist in Supabase
- âœ… Sample data is visible in Supabase dashboard
- âœ… Application builds without errors (`npm run build`)
- âœ… Application runs without errors (`npm run dev`)
- âœ… Components show sample data
- âœ… No console errors in browser
- âœ… Real-time features work (if tested)

## ðŸ“ž **Next Steps**

1. **Run the database setup script**
2. **Test your application**
3. **Customize with your own data**
4. **Deploy to production**
5. **Add real authentication**
6. **Connect to external services**
