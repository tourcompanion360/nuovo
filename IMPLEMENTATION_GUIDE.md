# Complete Workflow Implementation Guide

## üéâ What's Been Built

Your tour creator dashboard now has a **complete end-to-end workflow** with:

1. **Automated Project Provisioning** - One-click setup of client, project, chatbot, and portal
2. **End-Client Portals** - Private dashboards for each final client
3. **RAG-Powered Chatbots** - AI chatbots with memory and knowledge base
4. **Real-time Synchronization** - Changes by creators instantly reflect in client portals
5. **Plan Limits** - Enforced basic (1 project/chatbot) and pro (5 projects/chatbots) limits
6. **Analytics Integration** - Ready for external tour provider webhooks
7. **Knowledge Base Ingestion** - Import and embed content for chatbot training

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Database Structure
- **creators** - Tour creator accounts
- **end_clients** - Final clients (businesses that hire tour creators)
- **end_client_users** - Maps auth users to end clients (for portal access)
- **projects** - Virtual tour projects
- **chatbots** - AI assistants for each project
- **assets** - Media library (photos, videos)
- **analytics** - Metrics from external tour providers
- **requests** - Change requests from clients to creators
- **kb_chunks** - Knowledge base content (with pgvector embeddings)
- **conversation_messages** - Chatbot conversation history
- **memory_insights** - AI-generated insights from conversations

### Security (RLS Policies)
- **Creators** can only see/edit their own clients, projects, chatbots, assets
- **End clients** (portal users) can only see their own project data
- Plan limits are enforced at the database level (can't be bypassed)

---

## üöÄ How The Workflow Works

### For Tour Creators:

1. **Sign up and Choose Plan**
   - Basic plan: 1 project, 1 chatbot
   - Pro plan: 5 projects, 5 chatbots
   - Plans are enforced by database triggers

2. **Create a Client Project** (from TourVirtuali component)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Fill in client details (name, email, company, phone, website)
   - Fill in project details (title, description, type)
   - Configure chatbot (name, language, welcome message)
   - Click "Create Project"
   - **Behind the scenes:**
     - Calls `provision_project` Edge Function
     - Creates `end_client`, `project`, and `chatbot` in one transaction
     - Sends email invitation to client with magic link
     - Returns portal URL and project details

3. **Manage Projects**
   - View all client projects in dashboard
   - See analytics, chatbot stats, requests
   - Upload media to library (automatically linked to projects)
   - View chatbot insights and conversation history

4. **Handle Client Requests**
   - Clients submit requests via their portal
   - Creators see requests in "Requests" tab
   - Add creator notes and update status

### For End Clients (Final Clients):

1. **Receive Invitation Email**
   - Email contains magic link to portal
   - Click link to access portal (no password needed)

2. **Access Client Portal**
   - URL: `https://yourapp.com/client/:projectId`
   - View project overview
   - See analytics (views, visitors, engagement)
   - Browse media library
   - Chat with AI assistant
   - Submit change requests

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - When creator uploads media ‚Üí instantly appears in portal
   - When creator updates chatbot ‚Üí changes reflect immediately
   - When creator responds to request ‚Üí notification shows up

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup (Already Done ‚úÖ)
The migration has been applied with:
- pgvector extension enabled
- All tables created with proper relationships
- RLS policies configured
- Plan limit triggers active
- Helper functions for RAG similarity search

### 2. Deploy Edge Functions

You'll need to deploy the 4 Edge Functions to Supabase:

\`\`\`bash
# Install Supabase CLI if you haven't
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Set environment variables in Supabase Dashboard:
# - SUPABASE_URL
# - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (for embeddings and chat)

# Deploy functions
supabase functions deploy provision_project
supabase functions deploy chat_answer
supabase functions deploy kb_ingest
supabase functions deploy analytics_ingest
\`\`\`

### 3. Configure OpenAI API Key

The chatbot and knowledge base features require OpenAI:

1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Secrets:
   - Key: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `sk-...`

### 4. Test the Workflow

1. **Create a test project:**
   - Go to dashboard ‚Üí Client Projects Hub ‚Üí New Project
   - Fill in test client info
   - Submit

2. **Check the result:**
   - Project should appear in dashboard immediately
   - Client should receive email invitation
   - Check Supabase logs for any errors

3. **Test client portal:**
   - Use the magic link from invitation
   - Or navigate to `/client/:projectId`
   - Should see project data, analytics, media

4. **Test chatbot:**
   - In client portal, try the chatbot
   - Should respond with simple keyword-based answers
   - Conversation history is stored in database

5. **Test real-time sync:**
   - As creator: upload a media asset
   - As client: see it appear instantly in portal

## üìä Plan Limits

### Basic Plan (Default)
- 1 project maximum
- 1 chatbot maximum
- Enforced at database level (trigger)

### Pro Plan
- 5 projects maximum
- 5 chatbots maximum

### How to Upgrade a User
\`\`\`sql
update creators 
set subscription_plan = 'pro' 
where user_id = 'user-uuid';
\`\`\`

Or integrate Stripe webhooks to update automatically on subscription change.

---

## üîå Integrating External Tour Provider

To receive analytics from your tour provider (e.g., Matterport, Cloudpano):

1. **Add `external_tour_id` to project:**
   - When creating project, provide the tour provider's ID
   - Or update existing project:
     \`\`\`sql
     update projects 
     set external_tour_id = 'TOUR-123' 
     where id = 'project-uuid';
     \`\`\`

2. **Configure webhook:**
   - Provider webhook URL: `https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/analytics_ingest`
   - Add Authorization header with your `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

3. **Webhook payload format:** (see Edge Function section above)

---

## üß† Chatbot Memory & Insights

### How It Works:
1. **User asks question** ‚Üí stored in `conversation_messages`
2. **Message is embedded** ‚Üí vector stored with message
3. **Similar KB chunks retrieved** ‚Üí RAG provides context
4. **LLM generates response** ‚Üí stored in `conversation_messages`
5. **Stats updated** ‚Üí `chatbots.statistics` incremented

### Future: Automated Insights
Create a scheduled job (Supabase Cron or external) to:
1. Fetch last N days of messages per project
2. Use GPT to analyze and extract:
   - Top questions
   - Common topics
   - Issues/concerns
   - Sentiment
3. Store in `memory_insights`
4. Display in ChatbotInsights component

Example implementation:
\`\`\`typescript
// Scheduled function (daily)
const messages = await getRecentMessages(projectId, 7); // Last 7 days
const analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [{
    role: "system",
    content: "Analyze these chatbot conversations and provide insights..."
  }, {
    role: "user",
    content: JSON.stringify(messages)
  }]
});

await supabase.from('memory_insights').insert({
  project_id: projectId,
  period: 'weekly',
  top_questions: analysis.top_questions,
  topics: analysis.topics,
  summary: analysis.summary
});
\`\`\`

## üéì How to Explain This to Non-Technical People

**You:** "Our system now works like this: When you create a new client project, the system automatically sets up everything‚Äîthe client account, their private dashboard, and an AI chatbot that knows about their virtual tour. Your client gets an email with a link to their dashboard where they can see analytics, browse photos, chat with the AI, and send you requests. When you upload new photos or make changes, they see it instantly on their end. Everything is private‚Äîeach client only sees their own stuff, and you control all your clients from one place. We also have limits: basic accounts can have 1 client project, pro accounts can have 5."

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do Now

1. **Deploy Edge Functions** (see Setup Instructions above)
2. **Customize your chatbot logic** in the `chat_answer` function
3. **Test creating a project** from your dashboard
4. **Check the client portal** works
5. **Try the chatbot** with the simple keyword system
6. **Replace chatbot logic** with your own implementation
7. **Set up Stripe** webhooks if you want automated billing
